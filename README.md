Appchee's super successful app!

Appchee is a group of 4 collaborators who have implemented LearNews at Google's Android Camp in August 2014.

LearNews 
LearNews (learn+news) is a trivia app with multiple choice questions regarding the news from the past 12 months. The questions from LearNews are crowdsourced, thus they must contain links from reliable sources to back the information provided in the question. After learning the news, the users are offered a chance to get involved if there are charities or petitions available.

A user can choose to allow questions that they have answered before to line up or answer completely new questions. A user can also choose the category of the question. The questions are rated by their usefulness, giving the users posting the question a chance to up their level, pushing their questions higher in rank and appear to more users.

Motivation
People read or watch the news passively. Many charities do not raise awareness to people who would want to get involved or they simply are not easily accessible. LearNews offers an opportunity for charity organisations to reach out to people by asking an intriguing question, informing the user about their cause and allowing them to get involved in helping the major causes from the past year.

Even though nowadays the news is almost everywhere, some people are not aware of many of the major worldwide events. By adding social integration, users will want to compete against friends and share the information they have learned.
